## MiniSweeper

MiniSweeper is a version of minesweeper in discord, by utilizing the 5 by 5 row of buttons, I'm able to create a 5 by 5 minesweeper board.

## Advantages

- No databases, MiniSweeper uses discord's custom ids to store all the information.
- No gateway, instead of recieving events over gateway, MiniSweeper uses HTTPS by using the discord-interactions middleware.
- No library!!!! MiniSweeper utilizes HTTPS to make raw api requests. :)
- Share with your friends, by going to the website, you can hit the share button and your board gets embedded in discord! (See below)
- More sharing, also by clicking the link, your friends can see the board like it was in discord.
